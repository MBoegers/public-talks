# Code examples for Sealed Classes
All Code examples were presented in the talk.
I've added some comments and renamed some classes for better understanding.
Here are examples for:
+ Basic of Sealed Classes, see directory syntax
+ A demo how sealed calsses make API easier to understand, see directory api
+ How Sealed Classes play together with Pattern Matching for Switch Expression, see directory switching
+ Possibility of safe upcasting with Sealed Classes and Pattern Matching, see directory casting
+ Possible Future Fun with Futures :), see directory futures
